| Data Structure | Ordered  | Mutable | Constructor | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| List | Yes | Yes | [ ] | [1, 2, 3] 
| Tuple | No | ( ) | (1, 2, 3)
| Set | No | Yes | { } | {1, 2, 3}
| Dictionary | No | Yes | { } | {'One': 1, 'Two': 2, 'Three': 3} 

Python supports the following data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets. 
** When to use a dictionary: **
- When you need a logical association between a key:value pair. 
- When you need fast lookup for your data, based on a custom key. 
- When your data is being constantly modified. Remember, dictionaries are mutable. 

** When to use the other types: **
- Use lists if you have a collection of data that does not need random access. Try to choose lists when you need a simple, iterable collection that is modified frequently. 
- Use a set if you need uniqueness for the elements. 
- Use tuples when your data cannot change. 
Many times, a tuple is used in combination with a dictionary, for example, a tuple might represent a key, because it's immutable.
